## Build and run

To build and run a Go program, you will first need to have the Go programming language installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Go from the official website (https://golang.org/dl/).

Once you have Go installed, you can create a new Go file with the .go file extension. For example, you can create a file named "main.go" in your working directory.

You can then write your Go code in this file.

To build the Go program, you can use the go build command in the terminal. This command will take the Go source files, compiles them, and creates an executable file.

```bash
go build main.go
```

This will create an executable file named "main" in the same directory as your Go source file.

To run the Go program, you can simply execute the executable file that was created from the previous step.


```bash 
./main
```

Alternatively, you can use the go run command which will build and run the program in one step

```bash
go run main.go
```
